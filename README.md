# ArduRover
Project of an Ardupilot controlled Rover

This Project consists of the development of different robotic platforms controlled by a twin architecture: an ardupilot as the robot navigation controller and a RaspberryPi as the Mission controller. Once the Robot + Ardupilot platform is developed and tested, it will not be modified. To allow different missions to be performed, different Mission controller modules can be plugged to the platform to manage high level control.

1)	The first robot consists of a Radio controlled Monster Truck (model BSD Monster Truck: http://www.bsdracing.com/app/menu.php?op=show_product&product_id=14) where an Ardupilot APM 2.6 is installed and connected to Radio Receiver, servo, ESC, GPS, and Telemetry.
The project include Experimental logs, Photos, and video links.
Results so far: The robot is already following pre-made rout consisting of waypoints. It can be controlled by telemetry via an android tablet with Tower (DroidPlanner 3).
Next step is to control the robot via a notebook keyboard and joystick.
Next we will implement a follow-me control to make the robot follow an mobile phone.

2)	Next robot will be a two-wheeled platform with mountain bike wheels controlled by the Ardupilot.
